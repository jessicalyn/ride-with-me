      <h2>Welcome to Ride With Me!</h2>
      <p>Ride With Me is a carpooling application that connects drivers with passengers in need of a ride for a long distance trip. It allows drivers to have a more affordable ride by charging for available seats in the car, and it allows passengers to pay an affordable fee for an eco-friendly ride.</p>

      <p>By using Ride With Me, a user can search for a ride between different cities, choose the best ride for them and send a request to join that ride. The driver for that ride can then choose to accept or deny their request.</p>
      
      <p>All the payments are made in person, so there are no transaction fees involved.</p>
      
      <p>How it Works
      1. Find a ride
      Choose your desired departure and arrival cities, and, optionally, your desired travel date. You will then see a list of available rides between those cities. Read their descriptions, see the price and pick a ride you'd like to join.</p>
      
      <p> 2. Send a request
      Click on "Request to Join" to send a message to the driver. Be friendly! They can either accept or deny your request.</p>
      
      <p>3. Get in touch
      Once your request has been accepted, you'll receive an email with your driver's contact information, so you can get in touch. Coordinate the pickup location, departure time and payment method.</p>
      
      <p>4. Travel
      On the day of your ride, meet your driver at the pickup location. Remember to pay your driver before starting the ride. Enjoy your ride!</p>
